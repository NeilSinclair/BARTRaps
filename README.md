# BARTRaps
Repository for the "BART Learns to Rap" code for fine-tuning the Hugging Face Transformer BART Model

## Overview
This repository contains two notebooks used to fine-tune Hugging Face's BART model to rap. Using the pre-trained BART model's seq2seq capabilities, these notebook essentially allow on to easily fine-tune the model on any other seq2seq task.

The notebooks borrow relatively liberally from some of Hugging Face's fine-tuning scripts, however they allow one more control over the fine-tuning process.
